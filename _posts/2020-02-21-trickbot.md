Right out of the gate, the Suricata dashboard is telling us something is amiss.  

![](/images/2-20-20-1.png)

Let's pop over to the Discover tab and see what we can ferret out. We'll apply the `alert.signature exists` filter and add `destination.ip`, `source.ip`, `alert.signature`, and `alert.metadata.tag` and, pretty maids, all in a row.

| Destination IP  | Source IP    | Signature                                                      | Tag            |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 195[.]123[.]220[.]154 | 10.0.100.185 | ET CNC Feodo Tracker Reported CnC Server group 12        | Banking_Trojan |
| 185[.]65[.]202[.]240  | 10.0.100.185 | ET CNC Feodo Tracker Reported CnC Server group 8         | Banking_Trojan |
| 190[.]214[.]13[.]2    | 10.0.100.185 | ET CNC Feodo Tracker Reported CnC Server group 11        | Banking_Trojan |
| 104[.]20[.]16[.]242   | 10.0.100.185 | ET POLICY curl User-Agent Outbound                       | -              |
| 104[.]20[.]16[.]242   | 10.0.100.185 | ET POLICY IP Check Domain (icanhazip[.]com in HTTP Host) | -              |

Boom, we found the Trickbot TLS connections, but what about `wecan23`?

*Note: As I dug through this, I found a lot of DNS traffic to blocklists (`cbl.abuseat[.]org`, `barracudacentral[.]org`, `uceprotect[.]net`, etc.). While the victim (or the pcap sampler) seemingly use these lists, I excluded this as it's not part of the infection.*

As we see in the the table above, `10.0.100.185` seems to be infected. So let's filter in on that IP address in Kibana.

Let's get rid of our known bad Destination IPs (above), the IP recon domains (`icanhazip` and `externalip.com`), and see what is left over to see if there's anything else we can find. I'm also going to drop the DNS server out (`10.0.100.2`), while there's good info there, we've got others to look at that might have more. If there's nothing, we can do a DNS hunt.

Of interest, the connection between `10.0.100.185` and `192[.]3[.]124[.]40` is over port `80`, but there's not a corresponding HTTP Zeek log, so we'll have to use Docket to carve the PCAP and check it out in Wireshark.

![](/images/2-20-20-4.png)

As we can see, the file name is `lastimg.png`, but the file type metadata has a magic number of `MZ`, which is a PE binary. Using `Export HTTP Objects` in Wireshark, we can see there are 2 "png" files called `lastimg.png` as well as `mini.png`. We'll carve those out and statically analyze them.

Using `exiftool`, we can see some interesting info, mainly that the original file was called `002.exe` and that the File Type is `Win32 EXE`, not an image (truncated).
```
$ exiftool lastimg.png
...
File Name                       : lastimg.png
File Type                       : Win32 EXE
File Type Extension             : exe
MIME Type                       : application/octet-stream
Image File Characteristics      : Executable, 32-bit
PE Type                         : PE32
Original File Name              : 002.exe
Product Name                    : 002.exe
...
```

Let's see what VirusTotal knows about these 2 files by searching their MD5 hashes [1](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/489eef73a1a5880f644f3b60267db7e8)[2](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/c1820b0685ea2c16a9da3efd2f3b58d9)...**EVIL!**.

Back to Kibana and see what else is there. As before, let's get rid of our known bad and all we have left is `203[.]176[.]135[.]102`.

![](/images/2-20-20-5.png)

Like before, it's only Connection log stuff, so let's carve the PCAP between `10.0.100.185` and `203[.]176[.]135[.]102` and see what we find in Wireshark, which appears to be posting host IDs, running processes, usernames, workstation domain, etc. to a server `Cowboy`.

There was a lot of this kind of data being uploaded; feel free to explore it on your own and...obfuscating all of this data is exhausting.

Until next time, cheers and happy hunting!
